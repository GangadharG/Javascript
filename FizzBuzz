Question:

Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with three exceptions. 
For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), 
print "Buzz" instead, and for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 print "FizzBuzz".


Program:

for (var i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
  var output = "";
  if (i % 3 == 0)
    output += "Fizz";
  if (i % 5 == 0)
    output += "Buzz";
  console.log(output || i);
}
