Difference between == and === in Javascript
-------------------------------------------


In Javascript, == is called as Double equals where as === is called as strict equals

Both are used to check whether two variables are equal or not.
It is always preferable to use === when you are checking the equality of two same types.s

Example:
	var number1 = 5;
	var number2 = 5;
	number1 === number2; 
	The above condition result to true
	number1 == number2;
	The above condition also result to true

Example:
	var string = “5”;
	var number = 5;
	string === number;
	The above condition result to false
	string == number;
	The above condition result to true

Example:
	0 == false;
	The above condition result to true
	“false” == false;
	The above condition result to false

The above 3 examples clearly explains the difference between == and === in javascript
